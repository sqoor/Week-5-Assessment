Create a function called repeatChar
that takes 2 parameters string and number,
and return the character number of times with space depends on the nubmer that pass
** Important: You should didn,t have extra space or comma at the end
** Important: the character one time capital letter and one time small letter if n
odd start with capital letter 
** Important: you should solve this question using while

Ex: repeatChar("a",2); => "a, A"
Ex: repeatChar("C",5); => "C, c, C, c, C"

/* Q4:
Using recursion 
Create a function called stringToCapital
that takes a string 
and return the same string but convert it to upper case
** Important: you should solve this question using recursion
** Important: you should haven't any problem if there is a symbol

Ex: stringToCapital("My Name Is: Alex !") 
=> "MY NAME IS: ALEX !"
Ex: stringToCapital("Are you a student in coding ACADEMY by ORANGE ?")
